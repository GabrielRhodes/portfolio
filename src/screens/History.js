        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          I've learned more about the inner workings of politics, lobbying,
          economic industries, and what motivates individuals. It's also shown
          me how people have faught for change and achieved it. I've found how
          powerful education, community, and activism has been throughout all of
          history, which has sparked me into trying my best to focus on
          providing condensed information with which individuals can challenge
          their own beliefs.
