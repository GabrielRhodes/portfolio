        <h3>Application</h3>
        <p>
          While trying to lift a washing machine onto a dolly, the use of a
          lever made the task easier. From this use, I decided to create a{' '}
          <a
            href='https://gabrielrhodes.github.io/lever-calculator/'
            target='_blank'

          </a>{' '}
          that can determine the ideal mechanical advantage, efficiency, and
          friction of levers in different states. I've been able to make other
          small tasks easier such as using wrenches from the far end of the grip
          rather than the middle, which is just generally useful.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Physics has taught me that I can use mathematical rules of the world
          to quickly make certain tasks easier. I've learned about the limits of
          measurements, calculations, and the use of an answer. I've been able
          to use this information in countless small ways that have made small
          tasks easier than they might have otherwise been.
